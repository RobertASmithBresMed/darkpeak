This package is for use by Robert Smith & Paul Schneider at the University of Sheffield and Dark Peak Analytics.

- ArmaMarkovTDLoop uses C++ to speed up the running of time dependent cohort state transition models (where the transition probability matrix changes over time).
- There are plot functions for CEAC plots, CE-Plane plots, plots to check the stability of PSA results, a rankogram for cases where n_strategies >2.
- There are colour schemes (for all visuals).
- There is a markdown templates for reporting results (with header and logo etc).
- Also data for teaching (making markov models shiny parameters?).
